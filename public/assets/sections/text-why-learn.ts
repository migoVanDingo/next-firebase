export const whyLearnText = "We offer training that you cannot find anywhere else in New Mexico! We have the most comprehensive martial art from the Orient and Shao-Lin Kung-Fu is considered the origin of all the martial arts. True Shao-Lin training is for health and self-defense, not for body destructive gymnastics or point-sparring tournaments! At the Chinese Shao-Lin Center, you will train in a non-competitive, adult-centered environment. There are no trophies on the walls or other displays of ego. We also offer the most affordable rates for instruction in New Mexico. Training at the Chinese Shao-Lin Center of New Mexico is so comprehensive and inexpensive that it can replace having to go to a gym, running, swimming, taking self-defense courses, yoga, cross fit, meditation & tai chi, cross training, or MMA! You get all of that - and so much more - for less than $50 per month with a 1 year membership! Check out our Membership page to find the membership right for you!"
